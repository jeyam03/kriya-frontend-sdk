    "desc": "Non destructive testing is a testing and analysis technique used in industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system for characteristic differences or welding defects and discontinuities without causing damage to the original part. Why use NDT instead of conventional evaluation techniques? It is an effective technique via which the article can be tested without permanently altering its physical and chemical properties. It is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting and research. It is also a very safe testing method for operators with most techniques being harmless to humans with high accuracy.",
